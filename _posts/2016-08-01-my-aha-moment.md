WARNING this entry is very long I apologize I just got carried away and wanted to share every detail with all of you. 


I arrived in Reykjavik and hit the ground running. The streets are lovely they have different colored buildings and tons of graffiti murals.![]({{ site.baseurl }}/forestryio/images/DSC_0093-2.JPG =300X300)

Walking through the streets feels like a dream, not because it’s “dreamy” but because it does not feel real. Like when you’re dreaming and you are telling yourself wake up this is a dream this is not real, it was that kind of feeling except it is real. I quit my job, I have a one way ticket and I am in a country that I’ve never been with no one but myself.

Before I know it the hours go by and I’ve walked a total of 9 miles. It’s time for dinner and I look up a traditional Icelandic restaurant, I find one right in front of Hallgrimskirkja church.

As I walk in I see a familiar face, this man had been at the same airport as me in the morning, on my same bus and arrived at the same hostel. I introduced myself and turns out he was also on the same flight and from Chicago! I was so happy, we spent the entire dinner eating our Icelandic lamb soup (which needed some sirracha) talking about Wicker Park, Big Star tacos, West Loop, favorite ramen places in Chicago and our future travel plans. It was a sweet comfort for that hour.


The following day I wake up bright and early for my excursion. Our first stop is a volcanic cave in Thingvellir National Park, they gave us helmets and headlights. We head down into the cave and my initial thought upon entering was what the heck did I get myself into?! It’s cold, dark, damp and we are literally climbing over large lava rocks that are not necessarily stable “delilah please don’t trip and face plant, please don’t face plant  you cannot end up in the hospital on your second day of your trip.” As more time goes on I start to feel more comfortable, we get about midway through the cave when we are told to sit down and turn off our headlamps and sit there in silence. As a child like most I was afraid of the dark, welllll yeah as an adult sitting in a cold damp cave in the pitch black where you could not even slightly see your hand directly in front of your face—yeah I’m still afraid of the dark ha! We turn our headlamps back on and continue on at one point I stand up and bang the crap out of my head with the top of a lava rock, I just think “thank you for this helmet or else it would've been a bloodbath, such a klutz”. We exit the cave after about an hour of walking through it.

We head over to the Silfa. I had to stuff myself in a dry suit, it smelled like sweat and dampness, ugh so gross, I tried my very best to ignore it. Had it been my own sweat and dampness it would've been fine but who knows who had this suit on before me. There goes the nurse germ-a-fob in me. The suit was too big on me so they essentially place something that resembles a dog collar around my neck and two other collars around each wrist, I was slightly concerned at the risk of losing circulation to my brain but they are the professionals not me so I trusted them.

I arrive to the entrance and begin to walk down the stairs with my flippers on, once again I’m thinking don’t trip and face plant-(clearly this is a reoccurring thought since these kinds of things tend to happen to me frequently, it has to be genetic I am my father daughter for sure). As I begin to enter the water I can feel the dry suit start to compress against my legs, up to my body, I then lean forward and begin to float. As soon as the water touches my face it’s an instant pins and needle feeling, not a few pins either feels like a billion pins and needles to my face. Living and experiencing Chicago’s winters my entire life has not help prepare for this moment at all. I immediately think how long is it going to take to float through this Silfa I might possibly not make it through. Luckily within 2 minutes my face was so cold I did not feel it at, problem solved. Snorkeling through the tectonic plates was amazing, the water was so crystal clear blue, the clarity was about 30-40 feet deep. You were able to clearly see the tectonic rock formations. Between the buoyancy of the dry suite and the small current I literally just floated through the water. I did not use one ounce of energy and took in every moment as I floated through this 32 degree water. The water gets purified through the volcano so I took a few gulps of it and it tasted delicious, the most crisp tasting water I have ever had.

On day three my initial plan was to rent a car and drive the Golden Circle. One of the employees at the hostel I was staying at suggested I drive the southern coast towards the town of Vik he said there were some waterfalls that I could see. When I picked up my rental car I am feeling a little nervous since it’s my first time driving internationally. I put the first destination into my phone and head out of the city. My first stop was back to Thingvellir since I didn’t have time to explore during the excursion the day before. This was Iceland’s original site for parliament hundreds of years ago. The park was so impressive, the pictures speak for themselves.

After some time I headed on to the second stop, Geysir I was trying to stay on somewhat of a schedule since I was considering driving the southern coast but hadn’t made up my mind for sure. Along the drive to Geysir I must of stopped 10 times at different viewpoints, if I would of let myself I would of probably stopped another 20 more times. It was truly breathtaking to be on an open road surrounded by mountains, volcano, farms, and miles and miles of greenery in every direction.

I arrive at Geysir and begin walking towards the blow hole. Not necessarily feeling too impressed to see some hot water shoot out of the ground, I mean how impressive would it be? Well, I was wrong within the first 2 minutes of standing there it erupts into the air. I was blown away at the amount of force that must be behind it to naturally propel water more than 50 feet into the air-how on earth does mother nature do this? I sat and ate lunch there and seen Geysir erupt a total of 8 times.

I then headed onto to Gullfoss, the GPS sent me about 25 minutes away to then redirect me the direction I had came from. I arrive to the parking lot and feel the “itis” from lunch, I decide to open my car windows a bit and take a 30min power nap—ahhh best decision ever I woke up so refreshed and ready to go. I head over the the falls and from a distance you can hear the water roar, it's loud and powerful, I could feel the mist of the water on my skin, I start to walk just a little bit faster my anticipation is building. And there I see Gullfoss, it’s amazing it’s two falls in one, one on top another on the bottom.

It’s currently 5pm now and it’s decision time….do I keep going towards the southern coast or do I head back to my hostel. I go through a series of questions and thoughts it basically goes like this “ I have done zero research on the southern coast, that wasn’t in the original plan, what am I even going to see, the guy said waterfalls- but what type of waterfalls, is it worth it, will I be able to last, am I going to get tired” you get the point. Finally I say screw it, what the heck delilah this is what you came for just do it, go right now! I jump into my car and put on the podcast Serial-yes Serial I know I am a little behind but honestly it was the perfect driving podcast. About 20 minutes into the drive it starts to rain, I am not exactly thrilled but keep going. 2 hours into the drive it is still raining, I still haven’t come across anything and once again start to question if I had made the right decision. At this point it’s cloudier, the rain is coming down harder, I start to worry the rain is going to flood the road since it’s pretty leveled with the ground and only 2 lanes, a little bit of panic starts to set in-what if I get stuck, I have no idea where I am at, I haven’t seen another car on the road for over an hour. I know I’m not turning around I just have to keep going. 10 minutes later I see a waterfall to my left hand side in the distance and and all I can think is thank God finally something. I follow the road towards the fall and park. I put on my coat, grab my umbrella since it’s still pouring raining and begin to walk to the fall. The closer I get the windier it is, between the water of the rain and the water from the fall the umbrella becomes useless. The moment I seen the fall I began to feel a rush of emotions, I am taken back at how beautiful it is, I can feel the cold water hitting my face, the only sound I can hear is the water falling, as I continue to walk closer I realize you can walk behind the waterfall, my emotions are still building. The water if spraying everywhere, my pants, boots, jacket are all wet. I’ve closed the umbrella since it’s essentially pointless. I’m now standing behind the waterfall and my eyes are filled with tears. After driving 2.5 hours in the rain with periods of self doubt to some unknown area that I had not planned on visiting with no idea what to expect, this moment right here this aha moment is why I quit my job and came to travel. To go with the unplanned to see the unexpected. Every inch of my body was filled with so much joy and I was so proud of myself I couldn’t stop crying or smiling. By the time I made it back to my car, my fingers were pruned and my hair looked like I had just come out of the shower, my pants and jacket were soaked and I was happy.

I continued on my way to the town of Vik then headed back towards Reykjavik at this point it’s about 11pm and the sun is starting to set, it never gets pitch dark since it’s summer. I’m deeply engrossed in the podcast when after some time on the road I start to see a strip of orange, it begins to grow and then it hits me—it's the midnight sun!! ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/forestryio/images/DSC_0384.JPG =300X300)
Ahhhh yes!! Finally I get to experience it, I stop my car in the middle of the road, yes the middle of the road because I’ve literally been the only one on it for miles now. I get out of my car and watch it, I’m in awe it’s such an amazing phenomena. Where else in the world does the sunrise at midnight? This is seriously the coolest thing ever. I take some pictures and continue on to Reykjavik, upon arriving at my hostel the midnight sun is even brighter.  ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/forestryio/images/DSC_0391.JPG =300X300)
Day four I wake up to pouring rain and I decide to go back to sleep since hiking up a mountain in the rain doesn’t sound like the greatest idea to this city girl. When I wake up again it’s cloudy but the rain has stopped I take the bus over to Mount Esja, it sits right across from Reykjavik. As I begin the hike I am excited and a little nervous this is the first time I’ve hiked up a mountain alone. Within the first 15 minutes of the hike I am already out of breath, I wish it was a lie. The incline is pretty steep and my book bag now feels like 30 pounds instead of 10. I start to think ehh maybe you should just turn back around, after all this might not be a great idea. Once again doubt sets in my mind, at that moment I realize what the heck stop doubting yourself and decide I am going to do this. I am going to go up I don’t care how long it takes me. The hike up was probably a total of 2 hours with many, many frequent breaks to catch my breath. Hiking up the mountain was beautiful, it felt like being immersed within the clouds. It was hard, I was sweating, my muscles were on fire, but I kept pushing myself. And when I made it to the top it was all worth it. ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/forestryio/images/DSC_0411.JPG =300X300)

On my very last day in Iceland I went to a outdoor thermal pool. It was a bit of an experience, before getting in you had to get butt ass naked and shower off every inch of your body to “disinfect” yourself. And if you think there is the slightest chance you can sneak on in without showering you’re very wrong, the Icelandic people will watch you and make sure you have thoroughly showered if not they will call you out on it. No joke this really does happen, no modesty needed thankfully I’m in an entire different country with a very minimal chance of running into someone I know. So I followed the rules then headed into the thermal pools. It was immediate relaxation, the water was so warm my body was in an instant state of relaxation. This was exactly what I needed after all the walking and the hiking I had done. Sorry no pictures. This was the perfect end to my last day in Iceland. 

Iceland you’ve impressed me more than what I could have ever imagined.
